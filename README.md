# Chess-System-Tal-NNUE-2
UCI Chess engine written in C++ by Chris Whittington and Ed Schroeder

CSTal is a UCI engine and needs a User Interface (UI) such as CuteChess, Banksia or Arena to run.

CSTal is the big brother of Rebel 16, and is about 50 Elo pts stronger, putting it in at least the top five of freely available chess engines.
